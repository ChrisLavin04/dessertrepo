For a recipe where you want the flavour of chocolate to shine through, buy a good quality brand with a high percentage of cocoa, and adjust the recipe to suit it. If your chocolate is very dark, with little added sugar, you may need to make the recipe sweeter to give you the final flavour you want. Can I use chocolate chips? Chopped good good quality chocolate will make better chocolate chips than many ready-made chips which have added ingredients to stop them melting and sticking together.
